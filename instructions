First, I make certain all necessary Python libraries have been installed into my working version of Python.

Next, I ensure that the script "term_counter.py" script is placed into my working Python script folder. For me, that folder is here: C:\\MM-Python-Scripts\term-counter

I use a sample text file (for me, it's "sample_text.txt") where I paste the text from the document I want to analyze.

Next, I remove all hard breaks, capitalized letters, or unresolved symbols from the file using Sublime Text

Using the command prompt, I drill down to my working directory, (here I enter "cd C:\MM-Python-Scripts\term-counter" (omit ""s) 
This is the folder that will hold all of the files that need to be analyzed.

When I have finished regularizing my text file (removing hard breaks, capitalized letters, or symbols that might choke the script), I then paste it into line 24 of the script "term-counter.py" after input_string = 

Next, I make certain that my regularized text string is enclosed within 3 sets of quotation marks at the beginning and end of the text string. e.g., """acts and resolutions of the first session of the 158th general assembly"""

Going back to the command prompt, which should now be pointed at my current working folder (C:\MM-Python-Scripts\term-counter), I enter the following line command:

"python term_counter.py" (no quotation marks when entered) and then hit "Enter" (again, no quotation marks)

The script should churn out the entire list of word occurences and their totals inside of the document using Counter. If there are any error messages, it means that I need to double check that my sample_text.txt document has been completely cleaned and regularized for the script. 

The script will work when the document is formatted properly, without capital letters or hard breaks.

Once the report has been generated, the words and their totals can easily be brought into Excel and turned into tables, visual graphs, etc.
